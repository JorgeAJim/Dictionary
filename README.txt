**** This and most other of my repos will get their README update in the future on how the algorithm works and how I implemented my solution****

The purpose of this project was to take input from a text file and read all the words withing. Then the program would take user input to look up a word and then use hashing to find that word. 
The program was also responsible to suggest words if no words were found, under the assumption that there could've been a typing error.
